## üìú About

Just copy-pasted some code from somewhere and it's obscenely documented with unnecessary comments everywhere? *Remove Comments* will help you undocument the code and remove all the comments present in the code by doing the job for you.

*Remove Comments* is a **Visual Studio Code** extension.

### ‚ú® Features

* Supports both inline and multiline comments
* Support for 60+ languages üåê

> Note: This extension does not 'uncomment' the comments present in the code, but removes them completely altogether.

### üìù Usage

* Install the extension by searching for *Remove Comments* in the editor's 'Extensions' tab, or by launching VS Code Quick Open (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) and entering:

```txt
ext install sumonst21.clean-comments
```

* Once installed, remove comments in your code by opening the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>), entering "Remove all comments" and pressing enter.
